A calculator built with React that can perform the basic operations on any number of inputs.

## Basic Operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The expressions are evaluated from left to right, and a history of expressions evaluted is available. The current input and the history can be cleared at any time using the "clear" buttons at the bottom of the respective components.

*!! Be Advised !!*: There are no mechanics that prevents computation errors, such as Division by Zero, or input validation that prevents users from inputting an opeartion one after the other (i.e. 1 + 1 + + ... =).
